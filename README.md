# Task-Manager

Task Manager or Note-Taking App
Description:
Build a simple Task Manager or Note-Taking application where users can perform CRUD operations on tasks or notes. This project will include a user interface to interact with tasks/notes and use an API for data storage and retrieval.

Features:
- List View: 
Display a list of tasks/notes with details such as title, description, date, etc.
- Create Operation: 
Allow users to add new tasks/notes with relevant information.
- Read Operation: 
Enable users to view the details of a specific task/note.
- Update Operation: 
Allow users to edit and update the information of a task/note.
- Delete Operation: 
Provide an option to delete a task/note.
- API Integration: 
Use an external API to store and retrieve task/note data. You can use JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as a fake REST API for testing.

Tools and Technologies:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest for making API requests
- JSONPlaceholder API for data storage and retrieval
- Local storage for temporary data storage (optional)
- Bootstrap or another CSS framework for styling (optional)

Steps to Build:
- Design the user interface using HTML and CSS.
- Implement CRUD functionalities using JavaScript.
- Use Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest to interact with the JSONPlaceholder API for data operations.
- Implement error handling for API requests.
- Enhance the user experience with smooth transitions and notifications.
- Optionally, implement local storage to store data temporarily for a better user experience.

Goal:
- Demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Provides hands-on experience with API integration and asynchronous programming.
- Showcases understanding of CRUD operations and data manipulation.
- Allows for exploration of additional features like user authentication, filtering, and sorting.
